								<h3>Training the next generation of pro-democracy leaders</h3>

								<p>Since 2018, GenVote trainers have trained and supported hundreds of GenVoters and allies with our unique training modules. Through our 15+ training modules and coaching models, GenVoters receive the tools that they need to talk about our generation’s democratic crisis and develop electoral justice initiatives at the local, state and national level. In 2023, we launched a new online training resource library and weekly orientation calls to welcome new GenVoters. As of 2024, GenVote is the only national electoral justice organization in the youth voting ecosystem that provides such a robust educational mass training infrastructure.<p>

								<h3>Protecting the Youth Vote in Critical Elections</h3>

								<p>GenVote Defenders is the only nonpartisan national youth-led leadership program mobilizing Gen-Z to recruit hundreds of young people to become election protection volunteers, help voters exercise their right to vote, and mobilize young people to defend against potential attempts of election subversion in local communities across the country. Defenders undergo a 12-week, cohort style program with access to GenVote’s training modules, election protection resources, special briefings with election defense experts, and coaching.  In 2024, we ran GenVote Defenders alongside our state partners in NY, FL, MI, AZ, and TX.</p>
								<p>GenVote trained and supported 18 Defenders who recruited 90 Youth Election Protection Volunteers across key cities and engaged 16,684+ young people through outreach efforts like tabling, flyering, and digital campaigns. Over 3.5 weeks, 283 young people received 22+ hours of election protection training through 16 sessions led by the GenVote national team.</p>

								<h3 class= "text-center">(Phoenix, Arizona): June 2024</h3><br>
								<img src="img/GenVote EJ summit.png" alt="GenVote EJ summit" class="img-fluid"><br><br>
								<p>We are so proud to share that Generation Vote hosted the first youth-led Electoral Justice Summit in the United States (and our first-ever national convening!). From June 21-24, 2024, we invited and brought together 85 young leaders - including our own GenVoters - and democracy experts from across the country to Phoenix, Arizona for the inaugural “Our Generation’s Electoral Justice Summit.” Over the span of four days, we digested the latest threats to our democracy & youth voting rights, strategized new youth-led electoral justice demands and prepared for the biggest democracy fight of our generation’s lifetime in the lead-up to 2025 and beyond.<br><br>

								The inaugural Our Generation’s Electoral Justice Summit was years in the making and is the spark for a generational project that can unite the youth movement in our fight for electoral justice and a truly just and multiracial democracy in the United States. Two years ago, Generation Vote relaunched as a national youth-led electoral justice organization and embarked on a new journey to build a movement of young leaders fighting for our right to vote and a just democracy for all. Our team spent years traveling the country to hear from hundreds of young people and democracy advocates, and we often heard the same thing: In order to make progress on any of the issues our generation cares about, there was an urgent need to create a youth-centered space to address the latest threats to our democracy and lay the foundation for our generation’s vision for electoral justice.<br><br>

								Like a phoenix, Generation Vote rose to the challenge and assembled an incredible squad of partners to convene the first youth-led space to reflect on the state of the youth and democracy movements: Arizona Native Vote, Declaration for American Democracy Coalition, March for Our Lives, Young Feminist Party, SEIU, Next Gen America, Campus Vote Project, NAACP Youth and College Division, Lawyers Committee on Civil Rights, Black Voters Matter, Momentum Community and Common Cause. Following the successful Our Generation’s Electoral Justice Summit, GenVote will invite the participants of the inaugural convening to continue the momentum and spark a new youth-led Electoral Justice Alliance.<br><br>

								We are proud to share the following results from the Summit:
								<ul>
								<li><b>85</b> young leaders attended the Summit (90% of attendees were Gen-Z and millennials, 60% identifying as BIPOC)</li>
								<li><b>35</b> national and state-based organizations representing a wide berth of issues from democracy, gun violence prevention, immigration, student debt forgiveness, racial justice, gender justice, climate and tribal civic engagement and sovereignty.</li>	
								<li><b>19</b> sessions of programming</li>
								<li>Participants came from <b>14+</b> states, Navajo Nation, Hopi Tribe, and the Pechanga Band of Indians.</li>
								<li>Conducted <b>20</b> testimonial documentary-style videos for the Youth to Power video series: A documentary series for the Youth Movement</li>
							</ul>
								The Youth Electoral Justice Alliance will be a cross-movement, national community of organizations across the democracy, youth, social justice movements to raise the stakes of our generation’s democratic crisis and popularize “electoral justice” through legislative advocacy, public education and narrative change. </p>
